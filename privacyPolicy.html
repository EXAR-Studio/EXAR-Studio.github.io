            <li>We also process information about you where it is in our legitimate interests to do

            religion, political views, or sexual identity. Joining such gatherings or posting
            information on the Platform about these topics is entirely voluntary and, depending on
            the settings of the gathering and your profile (e.g., public or private), our legal
            basis for processing any sensitive information is either that you manifestly make it
            public or your explicit consent.<br />
            </li>
            <li>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process information about you,

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>EXAR is based in and governed by Canadian law and we will be processing,
            transferring, and storing information in and to Canada and other countries.<br />
            </li>
            <li>We have implemented technical and organizational measures to protect your personal
            information. We cannot guarantee these controls will provide absolute security.<br />
            </li>
            <li>This Privacy Policy is periodically updated, and does not apply to third
            parties.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>4.1 Transfer Of Information To Canada And Other Countries.</strong> EXAR is
            based in Canada. Information about you will be transferred to, and processed in, Canada,
            the U.S., and countries other than the country in which you are resident. These
            countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country
            and, in some cases, may not be as protective. We have taken appropriate safeguards, such
            as standard contractual clauses, to require that your information will remain protected
            in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>4.2 Security.</strong> We employ technical and organizational measures
            designed to protect your information that is under our control and that we process on
            your behalf from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,
            modification, or disposal, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example,
            we store all information that you provide to us on servers on which security controls
            are used. We train employees regarding our data privacy policies and procedures, and
            authorize employees to access personal information as required for their role. However,
            no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is
            completely secure.</p>
            <p>Where you have a password, which enables you to use our services, you are responsible
            for keeping this password complex, secure, and confidential. If you would like to update
            or change your password, you may select the <q>Forgot your password?</q> link on the
            login page. You will be sent an email that allows you to reset your password.</p>
            <p><strong>4.3 Data Retention.</strong> We may temporarily de-activate your account if
            you have not logged in for six months or more. You may contact us if you wish to
            reactivate your account.</p>
            <p>We retain certain information that we collect from you while you visit or are a user
            and/or subscriber of the Platform, and in certain cases where you have deleted your
            account, for the following business purposes:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>So you can use our Platform;<br />

            </li>
            <li>To provide you with a refund, if entitled;<br />

            <li>To provide accurate accounting information to subscribers about the gatherings that
            they organize or administer;<br />
            </li>
            <li>To better understand the traffic to our Platform so that we can provide all users
            and subscribers with the best possible experience;<br />
            </li>
            <li>To detect and prevent abuse of our Platform, illegal activities and breaches of our
            Terms of Service; and<br />
            </li>
            <li>To comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will
            either delete it or take steps to de-identify or anonymize it in accordance with
            applicable law.</p>
            <p><strong>4.4 Policy Scope.</strong> This Privacy Policy does not apply to information
            that you have provided or made accessible to third parties, such as other users,
            subscribers, and others with whom you may share information about yourself. Our Platform
            may direct you to a third-party service, such as social media services, or a portion of
            our Platform may be controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or
            pop-up window separate from other content on our Platform). Disclosure of information to
            these third parties is subject to the relevant third party’s privacy policy. We are not
            responsible for the third-party privacy policy or content, even if we link to those
            services from our Platform or if we share information with these third parties.</p>
            <p>Users and subscribers are directly responsible for complying with all requirements of
            applicable privacy laws in connection with the information that they obtain and process
            for the purposes of managing their contacts, organizing and communicating with other
            users and subscribers, or creating and hosting gatherings.</p>
            <p><strong>4.5 Revisions To This Policy.</strong> We may modify this Privacy Policy from
            time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current
            version and revising the date at the top of this page. Depending on the circumstances,
            we may provide additional notice to you of changes to this Privacy Policy, such as by
            sending you an email or by displaying a prominent notice on our Platform.</p>

            which we use to make better recommendations for content in your area, and to improve our
            Platform. If you do not want us to collect information about your location, then you can
            prevent this by taking the following steps:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>If using a mobile app, by changing the settings on your device.<br />

            <p>Your mobile device settings may also give you the option to choose whether to allow
            us to view your geolocation on a continuous basis, only when using the app, or never.
            Allowing us to view your geolocation when you are not using the app allows us to provide
            you with recommendations on a regular basis. Please refer to your device’s guide for
            additional information on how to adjust location services.</p>
            <p><strong>5.3 Cookies.</strong> We may use and allow others to use cookies, web

            <p>As stated above in Section 3.4, depending on where you live, you may have the right
            to opt out of the sharing or processing of your personal information for purposes of
            targeted advertising (targeting ads based on consumer activity across other sites and
            services), and you may be able to use your Cookie Settings to select cookies you would
            like to opt opt-out of, including those used for targeted advertising purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>5.4 Promotional Communications.</strong> You can control some of the messages
            that you receive from EXAR, other users, and subscribers by selecting the unsubscribe
            link in the message that you receive, or by adjusting the communication preferences in
            your account settings. We will also send you a link to these settings when you first
            sign up and in subsequent messages. If you opt out, we may still send you
            non-promotional messages, such as those about your account or our ongoing business
            relations. In addition, please consult the privacy policies of subscribers for
            information about how to control or opt out of promotional messages from them off the

            <p>During the preceding 12 months, EXAR has collected, used, and shared the categories
            of personal information described above in this Privacy Policy. We do not consider the
            ways we share your information as a <q>sale</q> for purposes of California law.
            California residents have certain rights to access, correct and delete their personal
            information and to request transparency about our privacy practices. If you would like
            to access or delete your information, or otherwise exercise your rights under the CCPA,
            please see Section 6. Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting
            information sufficient to confirm your identity, including by asking you for additional
            information. If you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different
            prices or provide different quality of services for exercising your rights unless those
            differences are permitted by law.</p>
            <p>If you are a California resident and would like to use an agent registered with the
            California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you
            have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid
            written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.</p>
            <p>Do-Not-Track Signals. Some mobile and web browsers transmit <q>do-not-track</q>
            signals. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this
            feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be
            transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in
            response to these signals.</p>

            <p>Profiles are intended to represent real people, businesses, and creators. Profiles
            must be honest and authentic.</p>
            <h3 id="transparency-feedback-and-ratings">Transparency, Feedback, and Ratings</h3>
            <p>All users and subscribers should be open about who they are, their intentions, and
            their affiliations. All content descriptions should be accurate, so users can make
            informed decisions about their participation and viewing of content.</p>
            <p>Gatherings, business, and creator feedback and ratings are important indicators of a
            user’s experience, and are meant to offer relevant and valuable insights into a user’s
            experience. All users and subscribers should leave ratings or feedback that accurately
            reflects their experience. For example, it is a violation of our policies to leave a
            negative rating solely in an attempt to harm the ratings for someone you dislike.</p>
            <h3 id="fake-accounts-impersonation">Fake Accounts &amp; Impersonation</h3>
            <p>Creating fake accounts, malicious accounts, or accounts meant to impersonate another
            person, is prohibited on the Platform.</p>
            <h2 id="respectful-communities">Respectful Communities</h2>
            <p>The Platform is intended to be a place where people can connect safely and
            respectfully online and offline. This includes respecting people’s time, attention,
            personal choices, and personal boundaries. Be respectful in interactions with people and
            in content posted on the platform. We may monitor and restrict behaviors that are
            dishonest, undermine the integrity of the platform, violate personal boundaries, or
            serve to intentionally upset people.</p>
            <h3 id="spam">Spam</h3>
            <p>Content sent to a user that is irrelevant, impersonal, unsolicited, promotional, or
            repetitive is spam. We may restrict access to features or the Platform based on reports
            of spam</p>
            <h3 id="content-authenticity">Content Authenticity</h3>
            <p>Posted content like gatherings, tours, and other content must align with the
            expectations of the user. Content descriptions and titles should clearly indicate the
            experience the user will have when viewing or interacting with that content.</p>
            <p>Our platform was built to solve loneliness in local communities. We believe it’s
            important for people to connect with one another, make friends, and enjoy company. We
            help businesses and creators build communities that don’t just buy products. These
            people care for each other and build the future of the community in their local
            region.</p>
            <p>To make this possible, EXAR requires content to meet some basic requirements:</p>
            <h4 id="provide-a-deeper-local-experience">Provide a deeper local experience</h4>
            <p>Gatherings, tours, and other content on the Platform should give users the
            opportunity to have a deeper connection with their local community. Here are some
            examples of how that can be accomplished:</p>
            <ul>
            <li></li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="create-social-connections-between-real-people">Create social connections between
            real people</h4>
            <p>Content on the platform should help create friendships, connection, and empathy
            between people. While we understand that businesses and creators need to create business
            outcomes using our tools and features, building for connection is the best way to ensure
            users are engaged and want to keep coming back.</p>
            <h4 id="content-recommendations">Content recommendations</h4>
            <p>Here are some examples of content that can be used as inspiration:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Group art tours that teach people about local public art<br />
            </li>
            <li>Board game nights where people can make friends through a low pressure
            activity<br />
            </li>
            <li>Wine tastings where people can learn and experience wine culture while making
            friends</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="collaboration-over-competition">Collaboration over Competition</h4>
            <p>Users and subscribers should work together to create content that is in the best
            interest of the community. In certain circumstances, users and subscribers may represent
            a business with financial interests. Deliberately sabotaging a business’s ability to
            reach their audience, run their business, or create for the community using our tools or
            features is prohibited.</p>
            <p>We encourage businesses to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit in
            creating content that will increase user engagement.</p>
            <h4 id="uniqueness">Uniqueness</h4>
            <p>While not strictly enforced, we strongly encourage subscribers to create content that
            is unique from other existing content on the Platform. Think about what makes your brand
            special and create gatherings, tours, audio, text, and images that help you stand out
            from the crowd.</p>
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> A generic paint night<br />
            <strong>Try:</strong> A Brazilian art night at a local cafe that features Brazilian
            coffee and themes in their branding</p>
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> A cocktail hangout<br />
            <strong>Try:</strong> A cocktail hangout at a bar in a financial district specifically
            for finance professionals that frequent the bar and would benefit from connecting with
            one another</p>
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> A dance party<br />
            <strong>Try:</strong> A salsa party occurring during a week-long Latin festival
            happening nearby</p>
            <h3 id="blocking-and-banning">Blocking and Banning</h3>
            <p>Users must accept and respect any subscriber’s decision to ban a user from viewing or
            interacting with their content, or a user’s decision to block another user from
            contacting them on the Platform. Users and subscribers must also respect any decision
            from EXAR to suspend or terminate their account due to a policy violation. Creating new
            accounts to circumvent a block or ban decision from a subscriber, a user, or EXAR is
            prohibited. Additionally, you are not permitted to post or promote content on behalf of
            a user that has been banned or blocked from using the Platform.</p>

            all child pornography to the relevant authorities.</p>
            <h3 id="other-content-restrictions">Other Content Restrictions</h3>
            <h4 id="bait-and-switch">Bait and switch</h4>
            <p>Do not switch content descriptions and titles at the last minute to get users to
            attend or view content they hadn’t originally intended to.</p>
            <h4 id="attendance-inflation">Attendance inflation</h4>
            <p>Do not fill gatherings with attendees in an effort to make them seem more popular or
            active. Especially do not create fake accounts for this purpose.</p>
            <h4 id="respectful-language">Respectful language</h4>

            <p>In order to provide a quality experience to our users, titles and descriptions of all
            content are to be relevant, useful, and easy to understand. Excessive or improper use of

            <h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
            <p>EXAR defines consent as welcomed communications and actions to engage with a user.

            <h3 id="privacy-of-others">Privacy of Others</h3>
            <p>Posting private information of other users or subscribers without their explicit

            <p>Users and subscribers should always be mindful of privacy and use discretion when
            sharing any private content that belongs to themselves or to other users or subscribers.

            <h2 id="bullying-harassment-manipulation-exploitation-and-hate">Bullying, Harassment,
            Manipulation, Exploitation, and Hate</h2>
            <p>Bullying, harassment, exploitation, and acts of hate undermine community building in
            safe spaces where people can trust one another. Building real relationships requires us
            to be more compassionate and kinder towards one another. EXAR enforces against behaviors
            that are threatening, intentionally malicious, or personally harmful - physically,
            emotionally, or mentally.</p>
            <h3 id="bullying-and-harassment">Bullying and Harassment</h3>

            <p>Harassment is persistent or non-consensual contact from another user or subscriber.

            <p>Hate speech, supremacy, or behavior that incites hate or violence against individuals
            or groups of people based on who they are or their beliefs, is prohibited.</p>
            <h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
            <p>All users and subscribers should take ownership over their personal safety and should
            never put themselves or others in danger. We expect all users and subscribers to be
            mindful of local laws when engaging with others. Where appropriate, subscribers should
            also set guidelines for their gatherings and content to ensure users are participating

            <p>EXAR reserves the right to remove credible explicit and implicit threats of violence
            or aggression and revoke the access to the Platform of the user who made them. Examples
            of prohibited implicit threats include, <q>The next time I see you, you’ll be sorry.</q>
            and <q>You better watch your back.</q></p>
            <h3 id="harmful-misinformation">Harmful Misinformation</h3>
            <p>The dissemination or promotion of misinformation is prohibited. This includes claims
            that have been scientifically disproven and that may pose a public or personal health
            risk.</p>
            <h3 id="self-injury">Self-Injury</h3>

            crime. We may also remove a user or subscriber based on their criminal record, for
            safety, or for other concerns. Users and subscribers with concerns about criminal or
            illegal activity should always report it to local authorities. We may or may not perform
            criminal background checks on users or subscribers at our sole discretion.</p>
