            because that document (and not this overview) is our legally binding agreement. The
            Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as
            automatic subscription renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes, and a
            class action waiver.</p>

            to users who are at least 18 years old. Additional eligibility requirements for a
            particular portion of our Platform may be set by any user who has the ability to
            moderate or manage that portion of our Platform. For example, the eligibility
            requirements for a Gathering may be set by the subscriber who published that

            may modify, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole
            discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the
            policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest
            of our community, or to protect our brand or Platform. When this happens, we will notify
            you of the reasons for the modification, suspension, or termination. We also may remove
            accounts of users who are inactive for an extended period of time. Please email

            terminate your access to that portion of the Platform.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3 Account Information and Security.</strong> When you register, you provide
            us with some basic information, including an email address and a password. Keep your
            email address and other account information current and accurate. Also, you agree to
            maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to
            disable your account). We strongly encourage you to choose a strong and unique password
            that is not shared with any other account or online service and practice other healthy
            password security habits to help avoid unauthorized access to your account. You alone
            are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security
            and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others. If someone
            is using your password or accessing your account without your permission, email us at

            renewal period, and the date and amount of your first payment. After your free trial

            Union are entitled to cancel with a full refund within 14 days after signing up to our
            Platform by emailing us at support@exarstudios.com. See the reference cancellation text

            either directly or indirectly, (a) extract data from the Platform for a commercial
            purpose not permitted by these Terms of Service, whether through use of an automated
            system or software, and whether operated by a third party or otherwise (<q>screen
            scraping,</q> <q>data scraping,</q> or <q>web scraping</q>); (b) engage in any activity

            to provide notice to users about your processing of their personal data, to obtain any
            necessary consents, and to respond to requests made by users as required by applicable
            law. You also agree to safeguard such data from unauthorized access or processing. You
            must delete such personal data once it is no longer strictly necessary for the
            administration of a Gathering or promptly following a request from EXAR, and you will
            promptly certify to such deletion.</p>
            <p><strong>5.6 Platform Modifications.</strong> We work hard to continuously improve our
            Platform. This means that we may modify or discontinue portions or all of our Platform

            <p><strong>5.7 Third Party Sites and Services.</strong> The Platform contains links to

            sites that may make available to you their content and products. We don’t control these
            third parties and aren’t responsible for those sites or services or their content or
            products. These third parties may have their own terms and policies, and your use of
            them will be governed by those terms and policies. You do not have a license to use the
            intellectual property of third parties merely by way of your access to our Platform.</p>

            <p><strong>9.1 Informal Resolution.</strong> Before making any claim, you and EXAR agree
            to try to resolve any disputes through good faith discussions. We use the term
            <q>claim</q> in this Section 9 to mean any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of
            or relating to your use of our Platform or this Agreement, including your participation
            in Gatherings. You or EXAR may initiate this process by sending written notice according
            to Section 11.2 describing the dispute and your proposed resolution. In the event that
            we cannot resolve the issue within 30 business days following receipt of the initial
            notice, you or EXAR may bring a claim in accordance with this Section 9. Users and
            subscribers based in the European Union may have additional or different rights, as
            provided by applicable law.</p>
            <p><strong>9.2 Exceptions.</strong> You or EXAR may assert claims, if they qualify, in
            small claims court in London, Ontario or any city where you live or work. You or EXAR
            may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in London, Ontario as
            necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or EXAR. EXAR may take
            action in court or arbitration to collect any fees or recover damages for, or to seek
            injunctive relief relating to, Platform operations, or unauthorized use of our Platform
            or intellectual property. Nothing in this Section 9 shall diminish EXAR’s right to
            modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to our Platform under Section
            2.2.</p>
            <p><strong>9.3 Class Action Waiver.</strong> You agree to resolve disputes with EXAR on
            an individual basis. You agree not to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in
            a class, consolidated, or representative action. <strong>You are expressly waiving any
            right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general
            actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>9.4 Dispute Resolution Terms Applicable to Individuals Based in the
            EU.</strong> If you are an individual based in the European Union, the mandatory
            provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident will apply. Nothing in
            this Agreement will affect your rights as a consumer to rely on the mandatory provisions
            of the local law that applies. If you are based in the European Union, the local laws in
            your European Union Member State may allow you to take legal action against EXAR in your
            Member State and to invoke certain local laws against EXAR. The European Commission
            provides for an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">online dispute resolution
            platform</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="intellectual-property">10. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p><strong>10.1 Intellectual Property of EXAR.</strong> EXAR and Cultured trademarks,

            circumstances and in our discretion, remove or disable access to material that we

            employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship between you and EXAR is intended
            or created by this Agreement. An user or subscriber on the Platform is not EXAR’s

            <p><strong>11.5 Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement and the relationship between you
            and EXAR shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario without regard to its
            conflict of laws provisions, except as provided in Section 9.</p>
            <p><strong>11.6 Judicial Forum.</strong> You and EXAR agree that any judicial
            proceedings (other than small claims actions) must be brought exclusively in the federal
            or provincial courts located in Ontario, and you and EXAR agree to venue and personal
            jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
            <p>If you are an individual based in the European Union, you may bring judicial
            proceedings against us arising from or in connection with this Agreement in your country
            of residence. In addition, for individuals based in the European Union, the European
            Commission provides for an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">online dispute
            resolution platform</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>11.7 Time for Filing.</strong> Any claim not subject to arbitration must be
            commenced within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or
            should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim, or the shortest
            time period permitted by applicable law. This clause does not apply to you if you are
            based in the European Union.</p>
            <p><strong>11.8 Assignment.</strong> This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or
            sublicensable by you except with EXAR’s prior written consent, but may be assigned or
            transferred by us to our corporate parent or any affiliate or subsidiary, or in
            connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, sale of all or
            substantially all of EXAR’s assets, or similar transaction.</p>
            <p><strong>11.9 No Waiver.</strong> A party’s failure to exercise or enforce any right
            or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision
            and does not waive any right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>
            <p><strong>11.10 Severance.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
            invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, you and EXAR nevertheless agree that the
            court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
            provision, and that the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
            effect.</p>
            <p><strong>11.12 Termination.</strong> If we terminate your account or access to our
            Platform, this Agreement terminates with respect to the individual account that has been
            terminated, provided that the provisions listed in Section 11.13 will survive such
