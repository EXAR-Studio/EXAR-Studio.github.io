            Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as
            automatic subscription renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes, and a

            to users who are at least 18 years old. Additional eligibility requirements for a
            particular portion of our Platform may be set by any user who has the ability to

            requirements for a Gathering may be set by the subscriber who published that

            may modify, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole
            discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the
            policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest
            of our community, or to protect our brand or Platform. When this happens, we will notify
            you of the reasons for the modification, suspension, or termination. We also may remove
            accounts of users who are inactive for an extended period of time. Please email

            <p><strong>2.3 Account Information and Security.</strong> When you register, you provide
            us with some basic information, including an email address and a password. Keep your
            email address and other account information current and accurate. Also, you agree to
            maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to
            disable your account). We strongly encourage you to choose a strong and unique password
            that is not shared with any other account or online service and practice other healthy
            password security habits to help avoid unauthorized access to your account. You alone
            are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security
            and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others. If someone
            is using your password or accessing your account without your permission, email us at

            time according to the terms and procedures described above. Users based in the European
            Union are entitled to cancel with a full refund within 14 days after signing up to our
            Platform by emailing us at support@exarstudios.com. See the reference cancellation text

            necessary consents, and to respond to requests made by users as required by applicable
            law. You also agree to safeguard such data from unauthorized access or processing. You
            must delete such personal data once it is no longer strictly necessary for the
            administration of a Gathering or promptly following a request from EXAR, and you will
            promptly certify to such deletion.</p>
            <p><strong>5.6 Platform Modifications.</strong> We work hard to continuously improve our

            third parties and aren’t responsible for those sites or services or their content or
            products. These third parties may have their own terms and policies, and your use of
            them will be governed by those terms and policies. You do not have a license to use the
            intellectual property of third parties merely by way of your access to our Platform.</p>

            <p><strong>9.1 Informal Resolution.</strong> Before making any claim, you and EXAR agree
            to try to resolve any disputes through good faith discussions. We use the term
            <q>claim</q> in this Section 9 to mean any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of
            or relating to your use of our Platform or this Agreement, including your participation
            in Gatherings. You or EXAR may initiate this process by sending written notice according
            to Section 11.2 describing the dispute and your proposed resolution. In the event that
            we cannot resolve the issue within 30 business days following receipt of the initial
            notice, you or EXAR may bring a claim in accordance with this Section 9. Users and
            subscribers based in the European Union may have additional or different rights, as
            provided by applicable law.</p>
            <p><strong>9.2 Exceptions.</strong> You or EXAR may assert claims, if they qualify, in
            small claims court in London, Ontario or any city where you live or work. You or EXAR
            may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in London, Ontario as
            necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or EXAR. EXAR may take
            action in court or arbitration to collect any fees or recover damages for, or to seek
            injunctive relief relating to, Platform operations, or unauthorized use of our Platform
            or intellectual property. Nothing in this Section 9 shall diminish EXAR’s right to
            modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to our Platform under Section
            2.2.</p>
            <p><strong>9.3 Class Action Waiver.</strong> You agree to resolve disputes with EXAR on
            an individual basis. You agree not to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in
            a class, consolidated, or representative action. <strong>You are expressly waiving any
            right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general
            actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>9.4 Dispute Resolution Terms Applicable to Individuals Based in the
            EU.</strong> If you are an individual based in the European Union, the mandatory
            provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident will apply. Nothing in
            this Agreement will affect your rights as a consumer to rely on the mandatory provisions
            of the local law that applies. If you are based in the European Union, the local laws in
            your European Union Member State may allow you to take legal action against EXAR in your
            Member State and to invoke certain local laws against EXAR. The European Commission
            provides for an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">online dispute resolution
            platform</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="intellectual-property">10. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p><strong>10.1 Intellectual Property of EXAR.</strong> EXAR and Cultured trademarks,
            logos, service marks, and service names are the intellectual property of EXAR. Our

            written consent.</p>
            <p><strong>10.2 Intellectual Property of Others.</strong> EXAR respects the intellectual
            property of others, and we expect our users to do the same. We may, in appropriate
            circumstances and in our discretion, remove or disable access to material that we
            believe may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. We may also restrict
            or terminate access to our Platform to those who we believe to be repeat infringers. If
            you believe your intellectual property rights have been violated, please review our <a

            purposes. Please continue to read this section carefully.</p>
            <p><strong>11.1 Translation.</strong> This Agreement was written in English. It was then
            translated into other languages. If there is any inconsistency between the English
            version and a translated version, the English language version controls.</p>

            href="#usage-and-content-policies">Usage and Content Policies</a>, constitutes the
            entire agreement between you and EXAR, superseding any prior agreements between you and
            EXAR on such subject matter.</p>
            <p><strong>11.4 No Agency.</strong> No agency, partnership, joint venture,
            employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship between you and EXAR is intended
            or created by this Agreement. An user or subscriber on the Platform is not EXAR’s
            representative or agent, and may not enter into an agreement on EXAR’s behalf.</p>
            <p><strong>11.5 Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement and the relationship between you
            and EXAR shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario without regard to its
            conflict of laws provisions, except as provided in Section 9.</p>
            <p><strong>11.6 Judicial Forum.</strong> You and EXAR agree that any judicial
            proceedings (other than small claims actions) must be brought exclusively in the federal
            or provincial courts located in Ontario, and you and EXAR agree to venue and personal
            jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
            <p>If you are an individual based in the European Union, you may bring judicial
            proceedings against us arising from or in connection with this Agreement in your country
            of residence. In addition, for individuals based in the European Union, the European
            Commission provides for an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">online dispute
            resolution platform</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>11.7 Time for Filing.</strong> Any claim not subject to arbitration must be
            commenced within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or
            should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim, or the shortest
            time period permitted by applicable law. This clause does not apply to you if you are
            based in the European Union.</p>
            <p><strong>11.8 Assignment.</strong> This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or
            sublicensable by you except with EXAR’s prior written consent, but may be assigned or
            transferred by us to our corporate parent or any affiliate or subsidiary, or in
            connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, sale of all or
            substantially all of EXAR’s assets, or similar transaction.</p>
            <p><strong>11.9 No Waiver.</strong> A party’s failure to exercise or enforce any right
            or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision
            and does not waive any right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>
            <p><strong>11.10 Severance.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
            invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, you and EXAR nevertheless agree that the
            court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
            provision, and that the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
            effect.</p>
            <p><strong>11.12 Termination.</strong> If we terminate your account or access to our
            Platform, this Agreement terminates with respect to the individual account that has been
            terminated, provided that the provisions listed in Section 11.13 will survive such
            termination.</p>
            <p><strong>11.13 Survival.</strong> Sections 3 (Fees, Payments, and Offers), 4.2

            provisions, shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
            <p><strong>11.14 Titles.</strong> The section titles in this Agreement are for
            convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The information in the
            <q>Terms of Service Overview</q> section and in the <q>Tips</q> and <q>Summary</q>

            <li>We process information about you in order to provide our services in accordance with
            our <a href="#terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, for example, to allow you to join

            <li>We also process information about you where it is in our legitimate interests to do
            so and not overridden by your rights (for example, in some cases for direct marketing,
            fraud prevention, network and information systems security, responding to your
            communications, the operation of gatherings by the subscribers and us, and improving our
            Platform).<br />
            </li>
            <li>Sometimes you provide us with sensitive information about you; for instance, the
            mere fact of joining a certain gathering may indicate information about your health,
            religion, political views, or sexual identity. Joining such gatherings or posting
            information on the Platform about these topics is entirely voluntary and, depending on
            the settings of the gathering and your profile (e.g., public or private), our legal
            basis for processing any sensitive information is either that you manifestly make it
            public or your explicit consent.<br />
            </li>
            <li>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process information about you,
            or may otherwise need the information to protect your vital interests or those of
            another person. For example, we may process information, if we believe doing so is
            required by, or in accordance with, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or
            audits.</li>

            collect by displaying it on our Platform according to your user profile and account
            settings. Some information, such as username, is always public. Some information, such

            <p><strong>3.2 Subscribers.</strong> Subscribers have access to the content within their
            gatherings, including information about gathering attendees and signups. Subscribers
            find it helpful to have access to the email addresses of users who attend or sign up to
            gatherings, to easily communicate with and administer the gatherings. Therefore, we may
            provide ways for you to share your contact information with subscribers.</p>

            connection with operating and improving the Platform to assist with certain business
            purposes, such as payment processing, email transmission, conducting surveys or
            contests, data hosting, managing our ads, and some aspects of our technical and customer
            support. These service providers, which include data analytics providers (as discussed
            further in Section 3.5 below), may access, process, and store information about you on
            our behalf for the purposes we authorize, subject to confidentiality obligations.</p>
            <p><strong>3.4 With our Analytics and Advertising Partners.</strong> We may share
            information we have collected about you with others or allow others to use technologies
            (like cookies, web beacons, and device identifiers) that collect information about your

            and to serve ads for EXAR.</p>
            <p>Depending on where you live, you may have the right to opt-out of the sharing of your
            personal information for purposes of targeted advertising (targeting ads based on
            consumer activity across other sites and services). EXAR provides you the opportunity to
            opt-out of this sharing, as described in Section 5 below.</p>
            <p><strong>3.5 Following The Law And Protecting EXAR.</strong> We may access, preserve,
            and disclose information about you to government entities and other third parties,
            including the content of messages, if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or
            required by, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits. We may also disclose
            information about you if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our <a
            href="#terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> or related guidelines and policies, or if

            <p><strong>3.6 Social Sharing And Other Tools.</strong> The Platform may offer social
            sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions that you take on
            our Platform with third-party services, and vice versa. Such features let you share
            information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you have chosen
            with the service. The third-party services’ use of the information will be governed by
            the third parties’ privacy policies, and we do not control the third parties’ use of the
            shared data. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and
            processing in connection with social sharing features, please review the privacy
            policies of the services that provide these features.</p>
            <p><strong>3.7 Affiliate Sharing And Merger, Sale, Or Other Asset Transfers.</strong> If
            EXAR is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or
            sale of our assets, information about you may be shared, sold, or transferred as part of
            that transaction. We may also share information about you with current or future
            corporate parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.</p>
            <p><strong>3.8 Other Situations.</strong> We may de-identify or aggregate information
            about you and share it freely, so that you can no longer be identified. Such information
            is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We may also share information about you with your consent or at your direction or
            where we are legally entitled to do so. For example, your information may be shared with
            gathering sponsors and others as described to you when you sign up to a gathering. Your
            information also is made available to other users and subscribers when you sign up for
            and participate in a gathering.</p>

            <li>EXAR is based in and governed by Canadian law and we will be processing,
            transferring, and storing information in and to Canada and other countries.<br />
            </li>
            <li>We have implemented technical and organizational measures to protect your personal
            information. We cannot guarantee these controls will provide absolute security.<br />
            </li>
            <li>This Privacy Policy is periodically updated, and does not apply to third
            parties.</li>

            <p><strong>4.1 Transfer Of Information To Canada And Other Countries.</strong> EXAR is
            based in Canada. Information about you will be transferred to, and processed in, Canada,
            the U.S., and countries other than the country in which you are resident. These
            countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country
            and, in some cases, may not be as protective. We have taken appropriate safeguards, such
            as standard contractual clauses, to require that your information will remain protected
            in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>4.2 Security.</strong> We employ technical and organizational measures
            designed to protect your information that is under our control and that we process on
            your behalf from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,
            modification, or disposal, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example,
            we store all information that you provide to us on servers on which security controls
            are used. We train employees regarding our data privacy policies and procedures, and
            authorize employees to access personal information as required for their role. However,
            no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is
            completely secure.</p>
            <p>Where you have a password, which enables you to use our services, you are responsible
            for keeping this password complex, secure, and confidential. If you would like to update
            or change your password, you may select the <q>Forgot your password?</q> link on the
            login page. You will be sent an email that allows you to reset your password.</p>

            you have not logged in for six months or more. You may contact us if you wish to

            <p><strong>4.4 Policy Scope.</strong> This Privacy Policy does not apply to information
            that you have provided or made accessible to third parties, such as other users,
            subscribers, and others with whom you may share information about yourself. Our Platform
            may direct you to a third-party service, such as social media services, or a portion of
            our Platform may be controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or
            pop-up window separate from other content on our Platform). Disclosure of information to
            these third parties is subject to the relevant third party’s privacy policy. We are not
            responsible for the third-party privacy policy or content, even if we link to those
            services from our Platform or if we share information with these third parties.</p>
            <p>Users and subscribers are directly responsible for complying with all requirements of
            applicable privacy laws in connection with the information that they obtain and process
            for the purposes of managing their contacts, organizing and communicating with other
            users and subscribers, or creating and hosting gatherings.</p>
            <p><strong>4.5 Revisions To This Policy.</strong> We may modify this Privacy Policy from
            time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current

            we may provide additional notice to you of changes to this Privacy Policy, such as by
            sending you an email or by displaying a prominent notice on our Platform.</p>

            to opt out of the sharing or processing of your personal information for purposes of
            targeted advertising (targeting ads based on consumer activity across other sites and

            link in the message that you receive, or by adjusting the communication preferences in
            your account settings. We will also send you a link to these settings when you first

            non-promotional messages, such as those about your account or our ongoing business

            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although

            <p>During the preceding 12 months, EXAR has collected, used, and shared the categories
            of personal information described above in this Privacy Policy. We do not consider the
            ways we share your information as a <q>sale</q> for purposes of California law.
            California residents have certain rights to access, correct and delete their personal
            information and to request transparency about our privacy practices. If you would like
            to access or delete your information, or otherwise exercise your rights under the CCPA,
            please see Section 6. Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting
            information sufficient to confirm your identity, including by asking you for additional
            information. If you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different
            prices or provide different quality of services for exercising your rights unless those
            differences are permitted by law.</p>
            <p>If you are a California resident and would like to use an agent registered with the
            California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you

            <p>Do-Not-Track Signals. Some mobile and web browsers transmit <q>do-not-track</q>
            signals. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this

            my subscription expires?</strong> {#what-if-my-subscription-expires?}</h1>
            <p>All subscriptions automatically renew, but your subscription may expire for two
            reasons:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>You cancel your subscription<br />

            <p>After that moment, your account will enter a 14 day grace period, during which you
            can always update your payment details to keep your subscription from expiring. If the
            subscription expires, you’ll lose access to the features of the Platform that you were
            paying for. However, you can start a new subscription at any time.</p>

            <p>We may permanently delete your information from our Platform at any time after the

            <p><strong>Once your content is permanently removed, it cannot be recovered on our

            <h2 id="profiles">Profiles</h2>
            <p>Profiles are intended to represent real people, businesses, and creators. Profiles
            must be honest and authentic.</p>
            <h3 id="transparency-feedback-and-ratings">Transparency, Feedback, and Ratings</h3>
            <p>All users and subscribers should be open about who they are, their intentions, and
            their affiliations. All content descriptions should be accurate, so users can make
            informed decisions about their participation and viewing of content.</p>
            <p>Gatherings, business, and creator feedback and ratings are important indicators of a
            user’s experience, and are meant to offer relevant and valuable insights into a user’s
            experience. All users and subscribers should leave ratings or feedback that accurately
            reflects their experience. For example, it is a violation of our policies to leave a
            negative rating solely in an attempt to harm the ratings for someone you dislike.</p>
            <h3 id="fake-accounts-impersonation">Fake Accounts &amp; Impersonation</h3>
            <p>Creating fake accounts, malicious accounts, or accounts meant to impersonate another
            person, is prohibited on the Platform.</p>
            <h2 id="respectful-communities">Respectful Communities</h2>
            <p>The Platform is intended to be a place where people can connect safely and
            respectfully online and offline. This includes respecting people’s time, attention,
            personal choices, and personal boundaries. Be respectful in interactions with people and
            in content posted on the platform. We may monitor and restrict behaviors that are
            dishonest, undermine the integrity of the platform, violate personal boundaries, or
            serve to intentionally upset people.</p>
            <h3 id="spam">Spam</h3>
            <p>Content sent to a user that is irrelevant, impersonal, unsolicited, promotional, or
            repetitive is spam. We may restrict access to features or the Platform based on reports
            of spam</p>
            <h3 id="content-authenticity">Content Authenticity</h3>
            <p>Posted content like gatherings, tours, and other content must align with the
            expectations of the user. Content descriptions and titles should clearly indicate the
            experience the user will have when viewing or interacting with that content.</p>
            <p>Our platform was built to solve loneliness in local communities. We believe it’s
            important for people to connect with one another, make friends, and enjoy company. We
            help businesses and creators build communities that don’t just buy products. These
            people care for each other and build the future of the community in their local
            region.</p>
            <p>To make this possible, EXAR requires content to meet some basic requirements:</p>
            <h4 id="provide-a-deeper-local-experience">Provide a deeper local experience</h4>
            <p>Gatherings, tours, and other content on the Platform should give users the
            opportunity to have a deeper connection with their local community. Here are some
            examples of how that can be accomplished:</p>
            <ul>
            <li></li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="create-social-connections-between-real-people">Create social connections between
            real people</h4>
            <p>Content on the platform should help create friendships, connection, and empathy
            between people. While we understand that businesses and creators need to create business
            outcomes using our tools and features, building for connection is the best way to ensure
            users are engaged and want to keep coming back.</p>
            <h4 id="content-recommendations">Content recommendations</h4>
            <p>Here are some examples of content that can be used as inspiration:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Group art tours that teach people about local public art<br />
            </li>
            <li>Board game nights where people can make friends through a low pressure
            activity<br />
            </li>
            <li>Wine tastings where people can learn and experience wine culture while making
            friends</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="collaboration-over-competition">Collaboration over Competition</h4>
            <p>Users and subscribers should work together to create content that is in the best
            interest of the community. In certain circumstances, users and subscribers may represent
            a business with financial interests. Deliberately sabotaging a business’s ability to
            reach their audience, run their business, or create for the community using our tools or
            features is prohibited.</p>
            <p>We encourage businesses to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit in
            creating content that will increase user engagement.</p>
            <h4 id="uniqueness">Uniqueness</h4>
            <p>While not strictly enforced, we strongly encourage subscribers to create content that
            is unique from other existing content on the Platform. Think about what makes your brand
            special and create gatherings, tours, audio, text, and images that help you stand out
            from the crowd.</p>
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> A generic paint night<br />
            <strong>Try:</strong> A Brazilian art night at a local cafe that features Brazilian
            coffee and themes in their branding</p>
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> A cocktail hangout<br />
            <strong>Try:</strong> A cocktail hangout at a bar in a financial district specifically
            for finance professionals that frequent the bar and would benefit from connecting with
            one another</p>
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> A dance party<br />
            <strong>Try:</strong> A salsa party occurring during a week-long Latin festival
            happening nearby</p>
            <h3 id="blocking-and-banning">Blocking and Banning</h3>
            <p>Users must accept and respect any subscriber’s decision to ban a user from viewing or
            interacting with their content, or a user’s decision to block another user from
            contacting them on the Platform. Users and subscribers must also respect any decision
            from EXAR to suspend or terminate their account due to a policy violation. Creating new
            accounts to circumvent a block or ban decision from a subscriber, a user, or EXAR is
            prohibited. Additionally, you are not permitted to post or promote content on behalf of
            a user that has been banned or blocked from using the Platform.</p>
            <h3 id="prohibited-content">Prohibited content</h3>
            <p>Here are some examples of content that should not be posted to the Platform:</p>
            <ul>

            offers, etc<br />

            <li>Content that is targeted to minors<br />

            <h4 id="nudity-sexuality-sex-solicitation-and-prostitution">Nudity, Sexuality, Sex
            Solicitation, and Prostitution</h4>

            content including but not limited to messaging, gatherings, augmented reality, photos,

            content will be removed from the platform and the uploader will be banned. EXAR reports
            all child pornography to the relevant authorities.</p>
            <h3 id="other-content-restrictions">Other Content Restrictions</h3>
            <h4 id="bait-and-switch">Bait and switch</h4>
            <p>Do not switch content descriptions and titles at the last minute to get users to

            <p>In order to provide a quality experience to our users, titles and descriptions of all
            content are to be relevant, useful, and easy to understand. Excessive or improper use of
            punctuation, symbols, capitalization, spacing, URLs, emojis, or repetition, intended to
            grab attention for a group or event, will need to be edited.</p>
            <p>We consider the following examples to be excessive or gimmicky use of numbers,

            <h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
            <p>EXAR defines consent as welcomed communications and actions to engage with a user.
            Engaging with anyone in a non-consensual way is strictly prohibited. If ever in doubt,

            <p>Users and subscribers should always be mindful of privacy and use discretion when
            sharing any private content that belongs to themselves or to other users or subscribers.
            For example, phone numbers, social security numbers, addresses, financial information,

            <p>Bullying, harassment, exploitation, and acts of hate undermine community building in
            safe spaces where people can trust one another. Building real relationships requires us
