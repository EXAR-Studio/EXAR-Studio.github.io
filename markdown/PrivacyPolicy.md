Our Privacy Policy explains how EXAR collects, uses, and discloses information about you. The terms “EXAR,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include EXAR Studios Inc. and our affiliates. We use the terms “user,” “you,” and “your” to mean any person using our Platform or attending gatherings, including any organization or person using the Platform on an organization’s behalf. This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of information about individuals that we collect when you use our “Platform,” which means any website, application, or services we offer, or when you communicate with us. For information about choices you may have under this policy, please see “Your Choices” below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information that you may provide to third parties, such as individuals, and others with whom you may share information about yourself. For more information about the scope of our Privacy Policy, please see Section 4.4. 

To make this Privacy Policy easier to understand, we have provided summaries in grey boxes below. These summaries are not part of the official policy. Even though we have provided summaries, it is important for you to read the entire policy carefully.

**1.1 Information You Provide to Us.** We collect information that you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information that you provide when you create an account, choose interests, fill out a form, or communicate with us. The types of information that we may collect include identifiers, such as your name, username, password, email address, postal address, and phone number; payment and commercial information, such as payment method data and purchases, if any; demographic information and any other personal information that you choose to provide, such as photos, choices of interests, gender, date of birth, groups, and professional or employment-related information, including your role, company, and years of experience. Certain information about yourself, such as gender and date of birth, is optional to provide. Your choice of interests is also optional, but we are required to process this information in order to administer your account, and to indicate that you are attending gatherings that you join.

Information that is public on our Platform is visible to others on and off the Platform.

**3.2 Subscribers.** Subscribers have access to the content within their gatherings, including information about gathering attendees and signups. Subscribers find it helpful to have access to the email addresses of users who attend or sign up to gatherings, to easily communicate with and administer the gatherings. Therefore, we may provide ways for you to share your contact information with subscribers.

Depending on where you live, you may have the right to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising (targeting ads based on consumer activity across other sites and services). EXAR provides you the opportunity to opt-out of this sharing, as described in Section 5 below.

**3.5 Following The Law And Protecting EXAR.** We may access, preserve, and disclose information about you to government entities and other third parties, including the content of messages, if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or audits.

**3.6 Social Sharing And Other Tools.** The Platform may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions that you take on our Platform with third-party services, and vice versa. Such features let you share information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you have chosen with the service. The third-party services' use of the information will be governed by the third parties’ privacy policies, and we do not control the third parties’ use of the shared data. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please review the privacy policies of the services that provide these features.

Your information also is made available to other users and subscribers when you sign up for and participate in a gathering. 

## 4\. Additional Details

**Summary:**

1. EXAR is based in and governed by Canadian law and we will be processing, transferring, and storing information in and to Canada and other countries.  
2. We have implemented technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information. We cannot guarantee these controls will provide absolute security.  
3. This Privacy Policy is periodically updated, and does not apply to third parties.

**4.1 Transfer Of Information To Canada And Other Countries.** EXAR is based in Canada. Information about you will be transferred to, and processed in, Canada, the U.S., and countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. We have taken appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, to require that your information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**4.2 Security.** We employ technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information that is under our control and that we process on your behalf from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, we store all information that you provide to us on servers on which security controls are used. We train employees regarding our data privacy policies and procedures, and authorize employees to access personal information as required for their role. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.

Where you have a password, which enables you to use our services, you are responsible for keeping this password complex, secure, and confidential. If you would like to update or change your password, you may select the “Forgot your password?” link on the login page. You will be sent an email that allows you to reset your password.

**4.3 Data Retention.** We may temporarily de-activate your account if you have not logged in for six months or more. You may contact us if you wish to reactivate your account.

We retain certain information that we collect from you while you visit or are a user and/or subscriber of the Platform, and in certain cases where you have deleted your account, for the following business purposes:

1. So you can use our Platform;  
2. To ensure that we do not communicate with you if you have asked us not to;  
3. To provide you with a refund, if entitled;  
4. To provide accurate accounting information to subscribers about the gatherings that they organize or administer;  
5. To better understand the traffic to our Platform so that we can provide all users and subscribers with the best possible experience;  
6. To detect and prevent abuse of our Platform, illegal activities and breaches of our Terms of Service; and  
7. To comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will either delete it or take steps to de-identify or anonymize it in accordance with applicable law.

**4.4 Policy Scope.** This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you have provided or made accessible to third parties, such as other users, subscribers, and others with whom you may share information about yourself. Our Platform may direct you to a third-party service, such as social media services, or a portion of our Platform may be controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or pop-up window separate from other content on our Platform). Disclosure of information to these third parties is subject to the relevant third party’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the third-party privacy policy or content, even if we link to those services from our Platform or if we share information with these third parties.

Users and subscribers are directly responsible for complying with all requirements of applicable privacy laws in connection with the information that they obtain and process for the purposes of managing their contacts, organizing and communicating with other users and subscribers, or creating and hosting gatherings.

**4.5 Revisions To This Policy.** We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. Depending on the circumstances, we may provide additional notice to you of changes to this Privacy Policy, such as by sending you an email or by displaying a prominent notice on our Platform.

## 7\. California Privacy Rights

During the preceding 12 months, EXAR has collected, used, and shared the categories of personal information described above in this Privacy Policy. We do not consider the ways we share your information as a “sale” for purposes of California law. California residents have certain rights to access, correct and delete their personal information and to request transparency about our privacy practices.  If you would like to access or delete your information, or otherwise exercise your rights under the CCPA, please see Section 6\. Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity, including by asking you for additional information. If you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services for exercising your rights unless those differences are permitted by law. 

If you are a California resident and would like to use an agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.  

Do-Not-Track Signals. Some mobile and web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in response to these signals.

All subscriptions automatically renew, but your subscription may expire for two reasons:

2. The credit card on file for your subscription is declined

### What happens to my account if my subscription expires?

If either of the above happens, your subscription will stay active until its scheduled expiration date.

After that moment, your account will enter a 14 day grace period, during which you can always update your payment details to keep your subscription from expiring. If the subscription expires, you’ll lose access to the features of the Platform that you were paying for. However, you can start a new subscription at any time.

### What happens to my content if my subscription expires?

When the grace period ends, your content will be removed from publicly accessible portions of the Platform. 

We may permanently delete your information from our Platform at any time after the grace period.

**Once your content is permanently removed, it cannot be recovered on our side.** However, you're always welcome to create new content after you start a new subscription.

# **Subscription refund policy**

EXAR only issues refunds to eligible subscribers who started a subscription on EXAR’s website or through the Google Play Store. [Consumer protection regulations](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/dealing-with-customers/consumer-contracts-guarantees/consumer-guarantees/index_en.htm) may apply to subscribers in the European Union.

# **Usage and Content Policies**

## Profiles

Profiles are intended to represent real people, businesses, and creators. Profiles must be honest and authentic.

### Transparency, Feedback, and Ratings

All users and subscribers should be open about who they are, their intentions, and their affiliations. All content descriptions should be accurate, so users can make informed decisions about their participation and viewing of content.

Gatherings, business, and creator feedback and ratings are important indicators of a user's experience, and are meant to offer relevant and valuable insights into a user's experience. All users and subscribers should leave ratings or feedback that accurately reflects their experience. For example, it is a violation of our policies to leave a negative rating solely in an attempt to harm the ratings for someone you dislike.

### Fake Accounts & Impersonation

Creating fake accounts, malicious accounts, or accounts meant to impersonate another person, is prohibited on the Platform.

## Respectful Communities

The Platform is intended to be a place where people can connect safely and respectfully online and offline. This includes respecting people's time, attention, personal choices, and personal boundaries. Be respectful in interactions with people and in content posted on the platform. We may monitor and restrict behaviors that are dishonest, undermine the integrity of the platform, violate personal boundaries, or serve to intentionally upset people.

### Spam

Content sent to a user that is irrelevant, impersonal, unsolicited, promotional, or repetitive is spam. We may restrict access to features or the Platform based on reports of spam

### Content Authenticity

Posted content like gatherings, tours, and other content must align with the expectations of the user. Content descriptions and titles should clearly indicate the experience the user will have when viewing or interacting with that content.

Our platform was built to solve loneliness in local communities. We believe it’s important for people to connect with one another, make friends, and enjoy company. We help businesses and creators build communities that don’t just buy products. These people care for each other and build the future of the community in their local region.

To make this possible, EXAR requires content to meet some basic requirements:

#### Provide a deeper local experience

Gatherings, tours, and other content on the Platform should give users the opportunity to have a deeper connection with their local community. Here are some examples of how that can be accomplished:

* 

#### Create social connections between real people

Content on the platform should help create friendships, connection, and empathy between people. While we understand that businesses and creators need to create business outcomes using our tools and features, building for connection is the best way to ensure users are engaged and want to keep coming back.

#### Content recommendations

Here are some examples of content that can be used as inspiration:

* Group art tours that teach people about local public art  
* Board game nights where people can make friends through a low pressure activity  
* Wine tastings where people can learn and experience wine culture while making friends

#### Collaboration over Competition

Users and subscribers should work together to create content that is in the best interest of the community. In certain circumstances, users and subscribers may represent a business with financial interests. Deliberately sabotaging a business’s ability to reach their audience, run their business, or create for the community using our tools or features is prohibited.

We encourage businesses to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit in creating content that will increase user engagement.

#### Uniqueness

While not strictly enforced, we strongly encourage subscribers to create content that is unique from other existing content on the Platform. Think about what makes your brand special and create gatherings, tours, audio, text, and images that help you stand out from the crowd.

**Instead of:** A generic paint night  
**Try:** A Brazilian art night at a local cafe that features Brazilian coffee and themes in their branding

**Instead of:** A cocktail hangout  
**Try:** A cocktail hangout at a bar in a financial district specifically for finance professionals that frequent the bar and would benefit from connecting with one another

**Instead of:** A dance party  
**Try:** A salsa party occurring during a week-long Latin festival happening nearby
